            <h1>What does it mean to be conscious?</h1>
            <p>
                The definition of consciousness is quite simple. At it's simplest, consciousness is sentience or awareness of internal and external existence.
            </p>
            <p>
                While this concept may be a simple one, we can go minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, sometimes even years without being aware of our internal and external existence.
            </p>
            <p>
                It can be very easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of circumstances we call our lives, in which case our consciousness becomes hijacked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Luckily, there are practices that we can implement into our daily routines that can give us access to reclaiming our consciousness.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most popular and effective practices to regain control of our consciousness is meditation.

                Meditation is a practice where an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object,
                thought, or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.
            </p>
            <p>
                The positive effects of meditation, however, are not only limited to being more present in the moment. Below are some statistics about meditation.

        <h1>How do you meditate?</h1>
        <p>At first, it might be difficult to meditate. Rarely do we want to stop to take time out of our busy days to do, well, nothing. That's the jist of it. While it may seem counter-intuitive at first, the time that we take to do "nothing" with meditation can make a tremendous impact on the rest of our day. You can start now by simply taking a few deep breaths. Notice the sensations in your body, and check in with how everything feels. If you would like, you can close your eyes during this process so you can feel everything more clearly. If there is anything you want bring into your life, you can imagine what it would be like to have it. If there is anything you want to get out of your life, you can imagine what it would be like to release it. If you just want to relax, allow yourself to be. There will be thoughts that pass through, but you can simply think of them as clouds passing through the sky. Thoughts come and thoughts go. If the same thoughts continually come up, you can begin to notice them. Maybe take note of it and later on you can look at where those thoughts came from.</p>
        <p>
            Now that you have practiced meditating, you can begin to incorporate it into your daily life. Maybe you can start with something small, like 1 minute of meditation. If that's too much, try 5 deep breaths a day. Meditation doesn't have to be a complete time block either. It is possible to incorporate meditation into other areas of life as well. Simply making the effort to be completely immersed in the present moment is all it takes.
